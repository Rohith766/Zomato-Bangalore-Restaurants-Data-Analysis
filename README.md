# Project-Overview
The main goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Zomato Companies Bangalore Restaurants dataset. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to determine the best location to construct a hotel, the type of hotel that would be most suitable, and the cuisines that can be served to cater to the target audience.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Zomato Companies Bangalore Restaurants dataset, obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about various restaurants in Bangalore, including their location, type of cuisine, average cost for two people, rating, and more. This dataset will be the foundation for our EDA to extract insights and make informed decisions.

# Results and Findings
After conducting the EDA, we have obtained valuable insights regarding the best location to construct a hotel, the type of hotel that would be most suitable, and the cuisines that can be served. These insights can be used to make informed decisions and optimize the restaurant business strategy.
